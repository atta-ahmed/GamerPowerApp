# GamerPowerApp

## Overview

This project is a Swift-based iOS application that integrates with various APIs to fetch and display data. To ensure efficient and effective networking, image handling, and API management, we have utilized several third-party libraries.

## Libraries Used

### **Kingfisher**
Kingfisher is used for image downloading and caching. It simplifies the process of fetching images from URLs and provides built-in caching for improved performance. Key features include:
- Caching of downloaded images in memory and disk
- Support for progressive image loading and resizing
- Simple API for setting images from URLs with error handling and placeholders

Kingfisher handles the complexities of image management, reducing the need for custom caching logic and ensuring smooth image loading in the app.
